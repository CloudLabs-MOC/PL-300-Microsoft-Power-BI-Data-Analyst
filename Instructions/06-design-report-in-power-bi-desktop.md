	![Picture 11](Linked_image_Files/image(16).png)

6. Drag the image to position it at the top-left corner, and also drag the guide markers to resize it.

	![Picture 12](Linked_image_Files/07-design-report-in-power-bi-desktop_image17.png)

7. To add a slicer, first de-select the image by clicking an empty area of the report page.
8. In the **Fields** pane, select the **Date \| Year** field (not the **Year** level of the hierarchy).
	
	*The labs use a shorthand notation to reference a field. It will look like this: **Date \| Year**. In this example, **Date** is the table name and **Year** is the field name.*

9. Notice that a table of year values has been added to the report page.

10. To convert the visual from a table to a slicer, in the **Visualizations** pane, select the **Slicer**.

	![Picture 49](Linked_image_Files/image(18).png)

11. To convert the slicer from a list to a dropdown, navigate to Visualizations > Format visual > Visual > Slicer Settings > Style, and then select Dropdown from the dropdown menu.

	![Picture 18](Linked_image_Files/06_slicer_style-1.png)

12. Resize and position the slicer so it sits beneath the image and is the same width as the image.

	![Picture 19](Linked_image_Files/07-design-report-in-power-bi-desktop_image20.png)

13. In the **Year** slicer, open the dropdown list, select **FY2020**, and then collapse the dropdown list.

	![Picture 20](Linked_image_Files/image(21).png)

	*The report page is now filtered by year **FY2020**.*

14. De-select the slicer by clicking an empty area of the report page.

15. Create a second slicer, based on the **Region \| Region** field (not the **Region** level of the hierarch).

16. Leave the slicer as a list, and then resize and position the slicer beneath the **Year** slicer.

	![Picture 21](Linked_image_Files/07-design-report-in-power-bi-desktop_image22.png)


21. De-select the slicer by clicking an empty area of the report page.

22. To add a chart to the page, in the **Visualizations** pane, click the **Line and Stacked Column Chart** visual type.

	![Picture 51](Linked_image_Files/image(26).png)

23. Resize and position the visual so it sits to the right of the logo, and so it fills the width of the report page.

	![Picture 26](Linked_image_Files/07-design-report-in-power-bi-desktop_image27.png)

24. Drag and drop the following fields into the visual:

	- Date \| Month

	- Sales \| Sales

25. In the visual fields pane (not the **Fields** pane—the visual fields pane is located beneath the **Visualizations** pane), notice that the fields are assigned to the **X-axis** and **Column y-axis** wells/areas.

	![Picture 27](Linked_image_Files/image(28).png)

	*By dragging fields into a visual, they will be added to default wells/areas. For precision, you can drag fields directly into the wells/areas, as you will do next.*

26. From the **Data** pane, drag the **Sales \| Profit Margin** field into the **Line y-axis** well/area.

	![Picture 28](Linked_image_Files/image(29).png)

27. Notice that the visual has 11 months only.

	*The last month of the year, 2020 June, does not have any sales (yet). By default, the visual has eliminated months with BLANK sales. You will now configure the visual to show all months.*

28. In the visual fields pane, in the **X-axis** well/area, for the **Month** field, click the down-arrow, and then select **Show Items With No Data**.

	![Picture 52](Linked_image_Files/image(30).png)

29. Notice that the month **2020 June** now appears.

30. De-select the chart by clicking an empty area of the report page.

31. To add a chart to the page, in the **Visualizations** pane, click the **Map** visual type.

	![Picture 53](Linked_image_Files/image(31).png)

	- Location: **Region \| Country**

	- Legend: **Product \| Category**

	- Size: **Sales \| Sales**

34. De-select the chart by clicking an empty area of the report page.

35. To add a chart to the page, in the **Visualizations** pane, click the **Stacked Bar Chart** visual type.

	![Picture 54](Linked_image_Files/image-(33).png)

36. Resize and position the visual so it fills the remaining report page space.

	![Picture 35](Linked_image_Files/07-design-report-in-power-bi-desktop_image34.png)

37. Add the following fields to the visual wells/areas:

	- Y-axis: **Product \| Category**

	- X-axis: **Sales \| Quantity**

38. To format the visual, open the **Format** pane.

	![Picture 3](Linked_image_Files/formatvisual.png)

39. Expand the **Bars** and then the **Colors** group, and then set the **Default Color** property to a suitable color (to complement the column/line chart).

40. Set the **Data Labels** property to **On**.

	![Picture 2](Linked_image_Files/image(36).png)

41. Save the Power BI Desktop file.

	*The design of the first page is now complete.*

### **Task 5: Design page 2**

In this task you will design the second report page. When you’ve completed the design, the page will look like the following:

![Image of page 2, comprising a slicer and matrix.](Linked_image_Files/image(37).png)

*Important: When detailed instructions have already been provided in the labs, the lab steps will provide more concise instructions. If you need the detailed instructions, you can refer back to other tasks in this lab.*

1. To create a new page, at the bottom-left, click the plus icon.

	![Picture 42](Linked_image_Files/overview-1.png)

2. Rename the page to **Profit**.

	![Picture 43](Linked_image_Files/profit.png)

4. Use the **Visualizations > Format visual > Visual > Slicer Settings > Selection** pane to enable the “**Select All**” option.

	![Picture 43](images/M6-T5-S4.png)

5. Resize and position the slicer so it sits at the left side of the report page, and so it is about half the page height.

	![Picture 44](Linked_image_Files/07-design-report-in-power-bi-desktop_image40.png)

6. Add a matrix visual, and resize and position it so it fills the remaining space of the report page

	![Picture 45](Linked_image_Files/07-design-report-in-power-bi-desktop_image41.png)
	
	![](Linked_image_Files/matrix.png)

7. Add the **Date \| Fiscal** hierarchy to the matrix **Rows** well/area.

	![Picture 46](Linked_image_Files/image(42).png)

8. Add the following five **Sales** table fields to the **Values** well/area:

	- Orders (from the **Counts** folder)

	- Sales

	- Cost

	- Profit

	- Profit Margin

	![Picture 55](Linked_image_Files/image(43).png)

9. In the **Filters** pane (located at the left of the **Visualizations** pane), notice the **Filter On This Page** well/area (you may need to scroll down).

	![Picture 57](Linked_image_Files/image(44).png)

10. From the **Data** pane, drag the **Product \| Category** field into the **Filter On This Page** well/area.

11. Inside the filter card, at the top-right, click the arrow to collapse the card.

	![Picture 58](Linked_image_Files/image(45).png)

	*Fields added to the **Filters** pane can achieve the same result as a slicer. One difference is they don’t take up space on the report page. Another difference is that they can be configured to achieve more sophisticated filtering requirements.*

12. Add each of the following **Product** table fields to the **Filter On This Page** well/area, collapsing each, directly beneath the **Category** card:

	- Subcategory

	- Product

	- Color

	![Picture 60](Linked_image_Files/image(46).png)

13. Save the Power BI Desktop file.

	*The design of the second page is now complete.*

### **Task 6: Design page 3**

In this task you will design the third—and final—report page. When you’ve completed the design, the page will look like the following:

![Image of page 3, comprising a slicer and three visuals.](Linked_image_Files/image(47).png)

1. Create a new page, and then rename it as **My Performance**.

	![](Linked_image_Files/performance.png)

1. To simulate the performance of row-level security filters, drag the **Salesperson (Performance) \| Salesperson** field to the page level filters in the filter pane.
	
	![Image of Salesperson field in filter pane.](Linked_image_Files/image(999).png) 

1. Select **Michael Blythe**. Data on the **My Performance** report page will now be filtered to display data for Michael Blythe only.

1. Add a dropdown slicer based on the **Date \| Year** field, and then resize and position it so it sits at the top-left corner of the page.

	![Picture 70](Linked_image_Files/07-design-report-in-power-bi-desktop_image49.png)

1. In the slicer, set the page to filter by **FY2019**.

	![Picture 71](Linked_image_Files/image(50).png)

1. Add a **Multi-row Card** visual, and then resize and reposition it so it sits to the right of the slicer and fills the remaining width of the page.

	![Picture 56](Linked_image_Files/image(51).png)

	![Picture 74](Linked_image_Files/07-design-report-in-power-bi-desktop_image52.png)

1. Add the following four fields to the visual:

	- Sales \| Sales

	- Targets \| Target

	- Targets \| Variance

	- Targets \| Variance Margin

1. To format the visual, open the **Format visual** pane.
   
   ![Picture 3](Linked_image_Files/formatvisual.png)

	- In the **Callout values** group, increase the **Text Size** property to **28pt**

	- In the **Cards** expand style set the **Background** group **Color** to a light gray color

	  ![Picture 79](Linked_image_Files/07-design-report-in-power-bi-desktop_image53.png)

1. Add a **Clustered Bar Chart** visual, and then resize and position it so it sits beneath the multi-row card visual and fills the remaining height of the page, and half the width of the multi-row card visual.

	![Picture 59](Linked_image_Files/image(54).png)

	![Picture 78](Linked_image_Files/07-design-report-in-power-bi-desktop_image55.png)

1. Add the following fields to the visual wells/areas:

	- Y-axis: **Date \| Month**

	- X-axis: **Sales \| Sales** and **Targets \| Target**

	![Picture 80](Linked_image_Files/image(56).png)

1. To create a copy of the visual, press **Ctrl+C**, and then press **Ctrl+V**.

1. Position the new visual to the right of the original visual.

	![Picture 82](Linked_image_Files/07-design-report-in-power-bi-desktop_image57.png)

1. To modify the visualization type, in the **Visualizations** pane, select **Clustered Column Chart**.

	![Picture 61](Linked_image_Files/image(58).png)

	*It’s now possible to see the same data expressed by two different visualization types. This isn’t a good use of the page layout, however, you’ll improve it in the **Enhance a Report in Power BI Desktop** lab by superimposing the visuals. By adding buttons to the page, you’ll allow the report user to determine which of the two visuals is visible.*

	*The design of the third—and final—page is now complete.*
